Due to the lack of a timing feature all tasks are executed immediately 
Three New Tasks: fixDoor, stopAtObject, throwObject    
The fixDoor task will reposistion the door after the player barged the door.       
The stopAtObject task will stop the player after reaching the treasure. In this case, the player will slow down rather than stop.    
The throwObject task will launch the object away from the player.
